  {
    "question": "What is meant by the term ‘development continuum’ in the WJEC GCSE Geography spec?",
    "answer": "The development continuum ranks countries from low- to high-income based on indicators like GNI per capita and shows gradual changes rather than strict categories."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Gross National Income (GNI) per capita measure development?",
    "answer": "GNI per capita divides a country’s total income (including overseas earnings) by its population, indicating average wealth but not distribution or quality of life."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the three components of the Human Development Index (HDI) and why are they important?",
    "answer": "HDI comprises life expectancy, education (mean years and expected years), and GNI per capita; together they provide a broader view of quality of life than income alone."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain one limitation of using GNI per capita as the sole development indicator.",
    "answer": "GNI per capita ignores income distribution, so a high average could hide extreme inequality where a small elite holds most wealth."
  },
  {
    "question": "Define ‘secondary sector’ and explain its relevance to development.",
    "answer": "The secondary sector involves manufacturing and industry; as economies develop, they typically shift from primary (agriculture) to more diverse secondary activities, boosting GDP."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the meaning of ‘core–periphery model’ in global development?",
    "answer": "The core–periphery model describes how wealthy ‘core’ countries dominate trade, finance, and technology, while poorer ‘periphery’ countries supply raw materials and labor."
  },
  {
    "question": "Identify two physical factors that can limit a country’s development.",
    "answer": "Mountainous terrain (hindering transport and agriculture) and a harsh climate (e.g., desert or extreme cold) can restrict economic activities and infrastructure development."
  },
  {
    "question": "How did colonialism historically impact development in former colonies?",
    "answer": "Colonialism often resulted in resource extraction for the colonizer’s benefit, disrupted local economies and governance, and left many colonies with weak institutions at independence."
  },
  {
    "question": "What role does political stability play in a country’s development?",
    "answer": "Political stability attracts investment, ensures consistent policies, and reduces the risk of conflict, all of which are essential for sustained economic growth."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain why education is considered a key driver of development.",
    "answer": "Education improves human capital by raising skills and productivity, leading to higher incomes, better health outcomes, and enhanced innovation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is meant by ‘sustainable development’ in the WJEC spec?",
    "answer": "Sustainable development meets present needs without compromising future generations, balancing economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection."
  },
  {
    "question": "Differentiate between renewable and non‑renewable resources.",
    "answer": "Renewable resources (e.g., solar, wind, biomass) can be replenished naturally at a similar rate to consumption; non‑renewable resources (e.g., coal, oil) exist in finite amounts and cannot be replaced on human timescales."
  },
  {
    "question": "Define ‘water scarcity’ and list one human cause.",
    "answer": "Water scarcity occurs when demand exceeds available supply; one human cause is over‑abstraction for agriculture, industry, and domestic use."
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe one strategy to manage water resources sustainably.",
    "answer": "Implementing rainwater harvesting systems collects and stores rainwater for later use, reducing reliance on freshwater sources and lowering extraction pressures."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is ‘energy security’ and why is it important for development?",
    "answer": "Energy security ensures reliable, affordable access to energy; without it, industrial production, healthcare, and education can be severely disrupted."
  },
  {
    "question": "Give one example of a renewable energy source and one advantage over fossil fuels.",
    "answer": "Wind power is a renewable source; it produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, reducing climate change impacts compared to fossil fuels."
  },
  {
    "question": "Define ‘food security’ as per the WJEC spec.",
    "answer": "Food security exists when all people have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food for an active and healthy life."
  },
  {
    "question": "Name two factors that can cause food insecurity in a developing country.",
    "answer": "Drought (leading to crop failures) and political conflict (disrupting distribution and markets) can both trigger severe food shortages."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain how irrigation schemes can improve food security.",
    "answer": "Irrigation provides reliable water to crops throughout the year, increasing yields, enabling multiple harvests, and reducing dependence on rainfall."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the role of fair trade in supporting development?",
    "answer": "Fair trade guarantees producers a minimum price and decent working conditions, fostering poverty reduction, stable incomes, and community investment in developing regions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Outline one advantage and one disadvantage of large‑scale dam projects in developing countries.",
    "answer": "Advantage: They generate hydroelectric power, boosting energy security. Disadvantage: They can displace communities and damage ecosystems downstream."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain the concept of the ‘development gap’.",
    "answer": "The development gap refers to the widening disparity between richer and poorer countries, reflected in income, health, education, and technology."
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe how microfinance can aid development in low‑income areas.",
    "answer": "Microfinance provides small loans and financial services to individuals lacking traditional bank access, enabling entrepreneurship and gradual income growth."
  },
  {
    "question": "In what way can non‑governmental organizations (NGOs) contribute to sustainable resource management?",
    "answer": "NGOs often implement community‑based projects—such as water conservation education or reforestation schemes—that promote local stewardship and long‑term resource protection."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain one reason why some countries remain trapped in a cycle of debt.",
    "answer": "High interest payments on existing loans divert funds from essential services (e.g., healthcare, education), making it difficult to invest in growth and repay debts."
