    "question": "What is the Quaternary period and why is it significant in studying climate change?",
    "answer": "The Quaternary period spans the last 2.6 million years and is marked by repeated glacial and interglacial cycles. It is significant because it provides evidence of natural climate variability and helps us understand past temperature changes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Name two types of evidence used to reconstruct past climates during the Quaternary period.",
    "answer": "Ice cores (e.g., from Greenland or Antarctica) and tree rings are two types of evidence. Ice cores contain trapped air bubbles that reveal past atmospheric composition, while tree rings show annual growth variations linked to temperature and precipitation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain the role of Milankovitch cycles in driving glacial–interglacial changes.",
    "answer": "Milankovitch cycles are long-term variations in Earth's orbit (eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession) that affect the distribution of solar energy received. Changes in these cycles alter seasonal and latitudinal insolation, triggering the advance or retreat of ice sheets."
  },
  {
    "question": "Define a tropical cyclone (tropical storm) and list its key characteristics.",
    "answer": "A tropical cyclone is a low-pressure system that forms over warm tropical oceans, featuring strong winds (sustained winds ≥ 74 mph for a hurricane) and heavy rainfall. Key characteristics include a clear eye, eyewall of intense storms, and spiral rainbands."
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe how sea surface temperatures contribute to the formation of tropical cyclones.",
    "answer": "Warm sea surface temperatures (above 26 °C) provide the heat and moisture that fuel tropical cyclones by causing increased evaporation. This latent heat release powers the storm’s updrafts and low-pressure system."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Coriolis effect and how does it influence weather systems?",
    "answer": "The Coriolis effect is the apparent deflection of moving air due to Earth’s rotation. In the Northern Hemisphere, it deflects winds to the right, and in the Southern Hemisphere, to the left, causing cyclonic systems to rotate and influencing global wind patterns."
  },
  {
    "question": "Briefly explain the difference between a low‐pressure system and a high‐pressure system.",
    "answer": "A low‐pressure system has rising air that cools and condenses, often producing clouds and precipitation (unstable weather). A high‐pressure system has sinking air, which warms and inhibits cloud formation, leading to clear, stable conditions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Identify one located example of a low‐pressure weather hazard in the UK and its impacts.",
    "answer": "Storm Desmond (December 2015) was a notable low‐pressure system that brought heavy rainfall and severe flooding to northern England and Scotland. Impacts included extensive property damage, transport disruptions, and power outages."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a rain shadow, and how does it affect the climate of leeward mountain slopes?",
    "answer": "A rain shadow is an area of reduced precipitation on the leeward side of a mountain range. As moist air rises over the windward side, it cools and loses moisture as rainfall; on descending the leeward side, the air is drier and warmer, creating arid conditions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe the structure of the Hadley cell and its role in global circulation.",
    "answer": "The Hadley cell consists of warm air rising near the equator (Intertropical Convergence Zone), moving poleward at high altitude, cooling and descending around 30° latitude, and returning equatorward near the surface. It drives tropical and subtropical wind patterns."
  },
  {
    "question": "Define an ecosystem and list its two main components.",
    "answer": "An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with their physical environment. Its two main components are biotic factors (plants, animals, microbes) and abiotic factors (soil, water, climate, nutrients)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain primary productivity in an ecosystem context.",
    "answer": "Primary productivity is the rate at which green plants and other photosynthetic organisms produce organic matter (biomass) from sunlight and CO₂. It forms the base energy source for all other trophic levels in an ecosystem."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the four main layers of a tropical rainforest and one distinguishing feature of each?",
    "answer": "Emergent layer (tallest trees reaching up to 60 m), canopy layer (dense continuous foliage ~30 m high, most biodiversity), understory (smaller trees and shrubs, limited light), forest floor (dark, decomposers breaking down organic material)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Compare the climates of tropical rainforests and deserts in terms of temperature and rainfall.",
    "answer": "Tropical rainforests have high, consistent temperatures (around 25–30 °C) and very high annual rainfall (above 2000 mm) with no pronounced dry season. Deserts have high daytime temperatures (can exceed 40 °C), large diurnal temperature ranges, and very low annual rainfall (below 250 mm)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe one physical adaptation of plants in hot desert environments.",
    "answer": "Cacti have thick, fleshy stems that store water and shallow root systems that quickly absorb rainfall. Their spines reduce surface area and protect against herbivores, while reducing transpiration."
  },
  {
    "question": "Outline the main characteristics of a UK deciduous woodland ecosystem.",
    "answer": "UK deciduous woodlands have a four-layer structure (canopy, understory, shrub, ground layer). Dominant tree species include oak, beech, and ash. They experience seasonal leaf shedding, support diverse fauna, and have nutrient-rich soils due to leaf litter decomposition."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does deforestation in tropical rainforests affect global carbon dioxide levels?",
    "answer": "Deforestation removes trees that sequester CO₂ through photosynthesis. When trees are cut and burned or left to decay, stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere, increasing greenhouse gas concentrations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain one sustainable management strategy for tropical rainforest ecosystems.",
    "answer": "Selective logging ensures only certain trees are harvested, leaving the overall forest structure intact. This reduces habitat destruction, maintains biodiversity, and allows for natural regeneration of the forest."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is desertification, and what human activities contribute to it?",
    "answer": "Desertification is the degradation of land in arid regions, making it more desert‐like. Human activities such as overgrazing, deforestation, and unsustainable irrigation remove vegetation cover and reduce soil fertility, promoting desert expansion."
  },
  {
    "question": "Identify one small‐scale UK ecosystem and a key ecosystem process occurring within it.",
    "answer": "A UK pond ecosystem features processes like nutrient cycling: decomposers (rotifers, bacteria) break down leaf litter and dead organisms, returning nutrients (nitrates, phosphates) to the water column, which support algae and aquatic plants."
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe the concept of biogeochemical cycles, giving one example from Theme 5.",
    "answer": "Biogeochemical cycles describe how chemical elements move through living organisms and the physical environment. An example is the carbon cycle: CO₂ is taken up by plants (photosynthesis), transferred to animals through feeding, and returned via respiration or decomposition."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain how a mid‐latitude depression (low‐pressure system) forms and impacts the UK weather.",
    "answer": "Mid‐latitude depressions form along the polar front where cold polar air meets warmer mid‐latitude air, creating a low‐pressure system. In the UK, they bring fronts that cause cloud, rain, and strong winds as they track eastward."
  },
  {
    "question": "What role do nitrogen‐fixing bacteria play in ecosystem nutrient cycles?",
    "answer": "Nitrogen‐fixing bacteria (e.g., Rhizobium in legume roots) convert atmospheric N₂ into ammonia (NH₃), making nitrogen available for plants to synthesize proteins, thus replenishing soil fertility in nitrogen‐limited ecosystems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Outline the main features of a polar cell and its effect on high‐latitude climates.",
    "answer": "The polar cell involves cold, dense air sinking at the poles, flowing outward at the surface toward 60° latitude, and rising as it meets warmer air. This circulation results in cold, dry conditions at the poles and contributes to polar deserts."
  },
  {
    "question": "Discuss how increased global temperatures influence the distribution of biomes.",
    "answer": "Rising temperatures can shift biome boundaries poleward or to higher elevations. For example, tundra regions may shrink as boreal forests expand north, and deserts may expand into formerly semi‐arid areas due to increased evaporation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of large‐scale hydroelectric schemes in tropical forest regions.",
    "answer": "Advantages: renewable energy generation, reduced reliance on fossil fuels, potential for local economic development. Disadvantages: flooding of large areas leading to deforestation, disruption of aquatic ecosystems, displacement of local communities, and methane emissions from submerged vegetation."
